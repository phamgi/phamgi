### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Giang(Jan), and I enjoy spending all of my time in front of the computer. My first and favorite language is Java because of its versatility and explixicity. I also enjoy designing and working on fun project while applying my fresh knowledge acquired from the open source (e.g. Springboot, React, HTML, CSS, AWS and much more).
